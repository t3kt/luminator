# Input and Control System

The input/control system takes input from the kinect, analyzes it, and sends it out to the other systems. It consists of the following sub-systems:

* Input (Kinect)
* Input Pre-processing
* Input Processing - takes input values and generates parameter values
* Output - takes parameter values and transmits them to external systems through various protocols, including MIDI, OSC, and TouchDesigner native DAT protocol
